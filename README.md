# Unlimited dungeons

An add-on module for the Dungeon World system for Foundry VTT to enable playing the Dungeon World rules hack [Unlimited Dungeons](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DY-vkVa9Hkqs-c5c_kP8ihU3LKKltsxv).

All content is sourced from the Unlimited Dungeons document and ported into the FoundryVTT module by FriendlyLambda. I tried to keep textual edits as minimal as possible and only change wording where it made references clearer (such as character sheet marks vs physical paper checkboxes).
