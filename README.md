# Unlimited dungeons

An add-on module for the Dungeon World system for Foundry VTT to enable playing the Dungeon World rules hack [Unlimited Dungeons](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DY-vkVa9Hkqs-c5c_kP8ihU3LKKltsxv).

All content is sourced from the Unlimited Dungeons document and ported into the FoundryVTT module by FriendlyLambda. I tried to keep textual edits as minimal as possible and only change wording where it made references clearer (such as character sheet marks vs physical paper checkboxes).

# Rules Note

All of the unlimited dungeon rules should work with this module **except** debility checkboxes, which currently apply -1 rather than disadvantage. I plan to issue a PR to the Dungeon World system module so this is supported in the near future.

# Credit

This module is based on the terrific work of [Mango Feet](https://gitlab.com/mangofeet) and their [Homebrew World](https://gitlab.com/mangofeet/homebrew-world-module) module. Thank you to [Mango Feet](https://gitlab.com/mangofeet) & [Matt Smith](https://gitlab.com/Asacolips) for their excellent system & add-on work to support Dungeon World in FoundryVTT.

When removing this module from your game world, the settings in the "System Settings" page will remain. You can change them individually or use the "Reset to Defaults" button at the bottom of the page to revert everything back to it's default state in the Dungeon World system.
