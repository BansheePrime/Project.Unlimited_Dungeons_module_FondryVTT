{"_id":"Q52NHLiUR53dJLJm","name":"Supplies & Treasure Systems","content":"<h1>Supplies</h1>\n<p>You don't have to count every coin spent or track every arrow used. The bulk of the player characters' equipment is replaced with a single resource called Supplies.</p>\n<p>Supplies are a catch-all resource for any type of useful gear that an adventurer might carry in their pack, including food, water, bandages, and arrows. Supplies are similar to adventuring gear, but their utility encompasses additional purposes.</p>\n<p>One use of Supplies is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enough food to feed everyone in the party for one day’s travel or one instance of Making Camp</li>\n<li>A use of adventuring gear or something worth a few coins</li>\n<li>Some extra arrows (c.f. Volley), a throwing knife, or a dagger</li>\n<li>Healing supplies for the First Aid move</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you search your pack for something useful and spend 1 use of Supplies, you produce a common, mundane item, something that you could have conceivably been carrying. Add the item to your inventory.</p>\n<p>At the GM’s option, Supplies may have additional properties, limitations, or utility, based upon fictional circumstances. For example, Supplies bought in a Dirt-poor steading may have only very crude or simple uses, or if your pack has been soaked with sewage, you can’t produce food from your Supplies anymore.</p>\n<h1>Treasure</h1>\n<p>Loot is not measured in valuation of coins. Instead, pieces of loot are assigned a tag, stating roughly how much they are worth. There are four tags which describe loot, in order of increasing value: shiny, valuable, precious, and priceless.</p>\n<p>The precise exchange rates between tags is imprecise and variable, but in general, a valuable piece of loot is worth 3-5 shiny pieces of loot, and a precious piece of loot is worth 3-5 valuable pieces of loot. Priceless loot is just that, it can't be traded for and it is very difficult to exchange for coin.</p>\n<p>Some types of loot like sacks of coins can be divvied up; others, like objects of art, need to be fenced. This may present further complications; small villages will be unlikely to have the resources to exchange a precious work of art for useable coin.</p>\n<p>The rules for Supplies and a tag-based economy are based from material originally written by Jeremy Strandberg.</p>","folder":"5pNvT7oaaSjKrb5x","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"5yw8weSeFyZ1vzKR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"RYI7KOh5VhoccexV","name":"Followers System","content":"<p>The rules in this section cover the creation, recruitment, and usage of followers, replacing the original Dungeon World rules for hirelings. These rules make followers feel more impactful and allow for greater customization.</p>\n<p>Only the penniless and foolhardy undertake an expedition without proper support in the form of porters, hunters, guides, and guards, not to mention specialists who can bring their skills to bear in several ways. Followers are those individuals who offer such assistance, accompanying the party on their exploits about the world.</p>\n<p>Like monsters, followers have HP, damage, and instincts. They also have moves and tags that indicate what they're good at and how they act. Unlike monsters, they have three additional statistics: Quality, Loyalty, and Cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Quality</strong> represents how effective the follower is, particularly in the areas defined by their tags and moves. A followers' Quality can range from -1 (rubbish) to +3 (masterful). A follower of average competence has a Quality of 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Loyalty</strong> tracks how committed the follower is to you and your cause. It usually starts at +1 but changes often, ranging from -1 to +3. Note that Loyalty is a resource to be used up by the GM like any other.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost</strong> describes what motivates the follower to follow. Although a strong leader or worthy cause can be motivating factors, all but the most selfless followers do the dirty work in exchange for coin or other material reward. A follower's Loyalty is increased when you pay their Cost. Costs aren't always tangible things, they may be include revenge against a common enemy, an opportunity to discover something, or the rush of glory in battle.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>pay a follower's Cost</strong>, increase their Loyalty by 1 (to a maximum of +3). In general, the higher the Follower's Quality, the greater amount of their Cost will be required to meet it.</p>\n<p>When <strong>a follower has -1 Loyalty</strong>, you cannot choose to decrease their Loyalty any further, and they will leave you at the next opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Instinct</strong> is comparable to a monster's Instinct. Instinct is the trouble that the follower gets into or pursues when idle or stressed. Commanding a follower to act against their Instinct requires making the Order Follower move.</p>\n<p>Followers deal and take damage like a monster does. When they would deal damage, roll a d6 and add their damage modifier (usually +0), just like any other damage roll. When they take damage, they lose HP. When they are reduced to 0 HP, they are out of the action and probably dead or dying—their fate is in the GM's hands.</p>\n<p>Followers who are with the party for a long time may evolve and advance, increasing in Quality or gaining tags or moves. This is purely at the GM's discretion and should be rooted in the fiction.</p>\n<p>See the moves <strong>Recruit</strong>, <strong>Order Follower</strong>, <strong>Do Their Thing</strong>, and <strong>Call for Assistance</strong> for more information on follower moves.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"5yw8weSeFyZ1vzKR":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"uJKTdXE87KNG3jML","name":"GM: Creating Followers","content":"<p>Like any important NPC, followers should have their own names. By default, followers have 6 HP, a damage modifier of +0, and can carry 2 weight beyond what they come equipped with. The GM will choose their specifics (Quality, Instinct, Cost, tags, etc.) as needed, to be discovered through play.</p>\n<p>As a benchmark for follower aptitude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reasonably competent: Quality +0, 2 tags, 1 move</li>\n<li>Skilled and experienced: Quality +1, 3 tags, 2 moves</li>\n<li>Very talented veteran: Quality +2, 4 tags, 3 moves</li>\n<li>Has lived a life of servitude and oppression: +meek</li>\n<li>Past their prime: -1 to Quality, +1 wise tag</li>\n<li>Has lived a life of danger: +2 tags</li>\n<li>Has lived a life of privilege: +1 tag</li>\n<li>Not their first adventure: +1 tag</li>\n<li>Specialist: +1 to Quality, -2 tags</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Follower Tags</h2>\n<p>The first tag every follower has is a <em>Wise</em>, expressed as ______-wise, where the blank is filled by whatever subject or thing the follower knows best. Write down the follower's Wise.</p>\n<p>If the follower has more than 1 tag, choose additional tags from the Follower Tags list, either now or as needed.</p>\n<h2>Follower Moves</h2>\n<p>Write 1-3 moves for the follower that further describe their behavior and abilities. These are for you, the GM. Use them like other GM moves, when the players look to you to see what the follower does, or when they give you a golden opportunity. The players might order or expect a follower to use one of these moves on their behalf; that's fine, but you may require them to Order Followers or that the follower Do Their Thing if the situation is stressful or chancy. A follower move reflects a skill, ability, or trait that can't be better summarized by a tag. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Point out a flaw in the plan</li>\n<li>Notice something hidden</li>\n<li>Follow quarry by tracks and spoor</li>\n<li>Tend to the sick and injured</li>\n<li>Divine the future</li>\n<li>Poison someone</li>\n<li>Maintain and operate the ship</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Loyalty</h2>\n<p>By default, a new follower starts with Loyalty +1, but the GM may add or subtract 1 Loyalty to reflect their initial disposition and their respect (or lack thereof) for the characters they follow.</p>\n<h2>Instinct</h2>\n<p>What does the follower do naturally that might cause trouble? Choose one, make one up, or roll 1d6:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hold grudges and seek ayback</li>\n<li>Slack off and give into temptation</li>\n<li>Treat others as beneath them</li>\n<li>Hew to superstition and tradition</li>\n<li>Take things too far when given a chance to indulge</li>\n<li>Bicker and fight amongst themselves</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Cost</h2>\n<p>What motivates the follower to accompany and assist the characters?

They can carry an additional 2 weight.</li>\n<li><strong>healer</strong>: They have the knowledge and ability to provide aid to the injured and the sick. They can make the First Aid move, and they add their Quality to the HP recovered.</li>\n<li><strong>meek</strong>: They accept their lowly lot and will do degrading or unreasonable things without needing to Follow Orders.</li>\n<li><strong>magical</strong>: They are magical by nature or training, and sensitive to the workings of magic.

Please note that while Heritage is a part of each character's background, it is a separate and distinct mechanic from each playbook's Background move.&lt;/&gt;</p>\n<p>Your choice of race or heritage should ideally bring some creative influence into the conversation. An elven ranger isn't the same as a human ranger with pointy ears. When you create a new character, decide on your species, ethnicity, and cultural heritage, choosing anything or any combination of things that sounds interesting to you and the other players. Then <strong>choose two Heritage moves to start with</strong>, based upon your background. Heritage moves are simple phrases or actions your character can do that reflect your character's heritage: their ancestry, homeland, culture, or youth. <strong>You also get two Heritage boxes</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>At the start of each session (including the first one)</strong>, mark a Heritage box. When you <strong>draw upon your heritage to perform a task</strong>, erase a mark from one of your Heritage boxes and make one of your Heritage moves.

The GM may ask you to Defy Danger or give disadvantage to a move you make that follows when this downside impacts you.</p>\n<p>When you Level Up, if you are level 6 or higher, instead of choosing a new move or increasing a stat, you may gain a third Heritage box and write a third Heritage move. If you choose this option, you also immediately mark all of your Heritages boxes for free. You may only choose this option once.</p>\n<p>Using a Heritage move may allow you to obviate or overcome a Danger that would otherwise need to be Defied, or grant Lore without having to Spout it first. However, they should not be allowed to deal damage without having to roll for it. Using a Heritage move to set up or augment another move may give advantage on that move. Exactly what happens is left to the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p>If you are using the Heritage system, print up one of the half- sheets on the following page and add it to your playbook.
